House Price Prediction

A complete machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using synthetic housing data. This project includes data generation, cleaning, exploration, model training, and price prediction using Random Forest Regression.

üîç Features

Data Simulation: Generates a dataset with key features like square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, parking spots, and location.

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and applies one-hot encoding to categorical variables.

Exploratory Analysis: Visualizes price distribution, correlation heatmaps, and price vs. size relationships.

Model Training: Trains Linear Regression and Random Forest models, evaluates performance using MAE, MSE, and R¬≤.

Model Saving & Inference: Trains a final Random Forest model on the full dataset, saves it, and performs price prediction on new inputs.
